# Step 1: Install Poetry

Before we begin, ensure that you have Poetry installed on your system. You can install it using the following command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

```

After installation, you can verify it by checking the version:

```shell
poetry --version

```

# Step 2: Create a New Project

To create a new Python package, use the following command:

```shell
poetry new my_package

```

This command will create a new directory named my_package with the following structure:

```plain text
my_package/
├── my_package/
│   └── __init__.py
├── tests/
│   └── __init__.py
├── pyproject.toml

```

# Step 3: Configure `pyproject.toml`

The pyproject.toml file is the heart of your Poetry project. It contains metadata about your package, including its name, version, description, and dependencies. Open the pyproject.toml file and edit it to include relevant information:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "my_package"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A brief description of my package"
authors = ["Your Name <youremail@example.com>"]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
pytest = "^6.2"

```

# Step 4: Add Dependencies

To add dependencies to your project, use the poetry add command. For example, if you want to add requests as a dependency, run:

```shell
poetry add requests

```

This command will update your pyproject.toml file and install the package in your virtual environment.

# Step 5: Write Your Code

Now, you can start writing your package code. Open the my_package/__init__.py file and add your functions or classes. For example:

```python
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, World!"

```

# Step 6: Write Tests

It’s essential to write tests for your package. You can create test cases in the tests directory. For example, create a file named test_my_package.py:

```python
from my_package import hello_world

def test_hello_world():
    assert hello_world() == "Hello, World!"

```

# Step 7: Run Tests

To run your tests, use the following command:

```shell
poetry run pytest

```

This will execute your tests and show the results in the terminal.

# Step 8: Build Your Package

Once you are satisfied with your package, you can build it using:

```shell
poetry build

```

This command will create a dist directory containing your package files.

# Step 9: Publish Your Package

To publish your package to PyPI, you need to configure your credentials first. Use the following command to add your PyPI token:

```shell
poetry config pypi-token.pypi your-token-here

```

Then, publish your package with:

```shell
poetry publish

```

# Conclusion

You have successfully created a new Python package using Poetry! This guide covered the essential steps from installation to publishing. With Poetry, managing dependencies and packaging becomes a streamlined process, allowing you to focus on writing great code. Happy coding!

Python Data Types

This document provides an overview of the various data types available in Python, a versatile programming language widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Understanding these data types is crucial for effective programming in Python, as they dictate how data is stored, manipulated, and accessed.

# 1. Numeric Types

## 1.1 Integer

Integers are whole numbers, both positive and negative, without any decimal point. For example:

```python
x = 5
y = -3

```

## 1.2 Float

Floats represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point. They can also be expressed in scientific notation. For example:

```python
a = 3.14
b = -0.001
c = 2e2  # This is equivalent to 200.0

```

## 1.3 Complex

Complex numbers are represented as a real part and an imaginary part. They are defined using the letter 'j' for the imaginary part. For example:

```python
z = 2 + 3j

```

# 2. Sequence Types

## 2.1 String

Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. They can be single, double, or triple-quoted. For example:

```python
s1 = "Hello, World!"
s2 = 'Python is fun'
s3 = """This is a multi-line string."""

```

## 2.2 List

Lists are ordered collections that can hold a variety of data types. They are mutable, meaning they can be changed after creation. For example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'apple', 4.5]

```

## 2.3 Tuple

Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed after creation. They are defined using parentheses. For example:

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'banana')

```

# 3. Mapping Type

## 3.1 Dictionary

Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They are mutable and are defined using curly braces. For example:

```python
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}

```

# 4. Set Types

## 4.1 Set

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are mutable and defined using curly braces. For example:

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}

```

## 4.2 Frozenset

Frozensets are immutable versions of sets. Once created, their elements cannot be changed. For example:

```python
my_frozenset = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])

```

# 5. Boolean Type

## 5.1 Bool

Boolean values represent one of two states: True or False. They are often used in conditional statements. For example:

```python
is_active = True
is_logged_in = False

```

# Conclusion

Understanding Python's data types is essential for writing efficient and effective code. Each data type serves a specific purpose and can be utilized in various programming scenarios. By mastering these types, you can enhance your programming skills and develop more robust applications.
